# Keyboard navigation shortcuts

This page details keyboard navigation for people who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device, or who want to use a keyboard as much as possible. For keyboard shortcuts that are useful to all users, see Useful keyboard shortcuts instead.

:::{tip}
If you cannot use a pointing device like a mouse, you can control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. See {ref}`click-and-move-the-mouse-pointer-using-the-keypad` for details.

* - Keys
  - Action

* - {kbd}`Tab` and {kbd}`Ctrl+Tab`
  - Move keyboard focus between different controls. {kbd}`Ctrl+Tab` moves between groups of controls, such as from a sidebar to the main content. {kbd}`Ctrl+Tab` can also break out of a control that uses {kbd}`Tab` itself, such as a text area.

    Hold down {kbd}`Shift` to move focus in reverse order.

* - Arrow keys
  - Move selection between items in a single control, or among a set of related controls. Use the arrow keys to focus buttons in a toolbar, select items in a list or grid view, or select a radio button from a group.

* - {kbd}`Ctrl` + Arrow keys
  - In a list or grid view, move the keyboard focus to another item without changing which item is selected.

* - {kbd}`Shift` + Arrow keys
  - In a list or grid view, select all items from the currently selected item to the newly focused item.

    In a tree view, items that have children can be expanded or collapsed, to show or hide their children: expand by pressing {kbd}`Shift+→`, and collapse by pressing {kbd}`Shift+←`.

* - {kbd}`Space`
  - Activate a focused item such as a button, check box, or list item.

* - {kbd}`Ctrl+Space`
