# Chat preferences

The following options allow you to customize how Orca behaves when providing access to instant messaging and internet relay chat clients.

## Speak chatroom name

If this checkbox is checked, Orca will prefix incoming messages with the name of the room or buddy they came from, unless they came from the currently-focused conversation.

**Default value:** not checked

## Announce when your buddies are typing

If this checkbox is checked, and if Orca has sufficient information identifying that your buddy is typing, Orca will announce changes in typing status.

**Default value:** not checked

## Provide chat room specific message histories

If this checkbox is checked, Orca's commands for reviewing recent messages will only apply to the currently-focused conversation. Otherwise, the history will contain the most recent messages regardless of which conversation they came from.

**Default value**: not checked

## Speak messages from

This group of radio buttons allows you to control under what circumstances Orca will present an incoming message to you. Your choices are:

* All channels

* A channel only if its window is active

* All channels when any chat window is active

**Default value:** all channels
