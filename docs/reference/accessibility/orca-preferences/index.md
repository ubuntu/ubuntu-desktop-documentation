# Screen reader preferences

Orca preferences allow you to customize functionality in Orca which applies to all applications. An example of an Orca preference is key echo because key echo is something that applies to all applications.

Orca preferences can be configured globally or on the application level. Application-level preferences allow you to customize Orca functionality that only applies in certain environments, such as on web pages or in chat applications. As a result, you will only find these options available in the application-specific preferences dialogs and only for those applications to which these options apply.
