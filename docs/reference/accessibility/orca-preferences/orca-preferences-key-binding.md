## Orca Modifier Keys

The Screen Reader Modifier Key(s) combo box allows you to select which key or keys will serve as the Orca Modifier. The available options are:

* KP_Insert (the same key as the {kbd}`0` on the numeric keypad)

* Insert

* Insert, KP_Insert

* Caps_Lock

## Key bindings table

The key bindings table provides a list of Orca operations and the keys that are bound to them.

* The **Command** column contains a description of the Orca command to be performed.

* The **Key Binding** column contains the keyboard shortcut currently assigned to the Orca command. You can modify the value of this column by pressing {kbd}`Return`, pressing the keys for the new binding, and pressing {kbd}`Return` again.

* The **Modified** column serves both as an indicator to what has been changed and as a way to restore the default bindings associated with that command.

## Unbound commands

Beneath the list of Orca keybindings, you will find a group of unbound commands. These are commands can be useful for some users but are unassigned by default. 
Braille bindings are listed at the bottom of unbound commands list.
