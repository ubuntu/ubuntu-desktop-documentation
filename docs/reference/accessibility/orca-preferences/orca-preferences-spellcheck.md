# Spellcheck preferences

Orca tries to provide a consistent user experience when interacting with application spell checkers. For applications where this enhanced support has been provided, you will find several options which you can adjust to get the verbosity level that works best for you.
You can have both brief and verbose spell check information

If you normally want very little verbosity when using a spell checker, but occasionally need detailed information about a given error, you can disable these options. When you need additional details, just use Orca's detailed Where Am I command to have Orca present the current error as if all of these options were enabled.
