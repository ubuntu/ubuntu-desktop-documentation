You can browse this documentation using the following tags.

<!--
The _tags/tagsindex.md file is auto-generated by the sphinx-tags extension. Its purpose is for you to include it in your table of contents so that tags appear in the side bar.

However, in this project we don't want to expose tags in the side bar, at least for the time being. The file isn't included in any ToC. That causes a build issue because every file has to be included somewhere.

Rather than suppress the build warnings, I'm including the tags index in this mock file. It's configured as an "orhpan", which tells the build system that this file isn't supposed to be included anywhere.

In theory, I could also add the orphan configuration directly into _tags/tagsindex.md. This is difficult, though, due to that file being auto-generated at every build. Having this static Markdown file is easier to maintain than adjusting the Makefile and the Sphinx build process.
