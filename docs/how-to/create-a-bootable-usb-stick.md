## Using balenaEtcher

:::{note}
balenaEtcher is an open-source application but it isn't developed by the Ubuntu community. Recently, we've [learned](https://tails.net/news/rufus/) that it shares some information about your usage with the Balena company. If this a concern, consider using an alternative application: Startup Disk Creator or GNOME Disks on Linux, Rufus on Windows or Raspberry Pi Imager on any platform.
