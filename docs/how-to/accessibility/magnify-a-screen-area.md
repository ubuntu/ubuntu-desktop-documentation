# Magnify a screen area

Magnifying the screen is different than just enlarging the {ref}`text size <change-text-size-on-the-screen>`. This feature is like having a magnifying glass, allowing you to move around by zooming in on parts of the screen.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Zoom` section.
4. Enable the {guilabel}`Desktop Zoom` option.

You can now move around the screen area. By moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, you will move the magnified area in different directions, allowing you to view your area of choice.

:::{tip}
You can quickly turn zoom on and off by clicking the {ref}`accessibility icon <find-the-accessibility-menu>` on the top bar and selecting {guilabel}`Zoom`.

You can change the magnification factor, the mouse tracking, and the position of the magnified view on the screen. Adjust these in the {guilabel}`Magnifier` section.

You can activate crosshairs to help you find the mouse or touchpad pointer. Switch them on and adjust their length, color, and thickness in the {guilabel}`Crosshairs` section.

You can switch to inverted colors video, and adjust brightness, contrast and color options for the magnifier in the {guilabel}`Color Filters` section. The combination of these options is useful for people with low-vision, any degree of photophobia, or just for using the computer under adverse lighting conditions.
