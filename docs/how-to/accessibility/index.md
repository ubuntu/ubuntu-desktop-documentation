# Accessibility

Ubuntu aims at making the operating system, and its derivatives, usable by as many people as possible across ages, languages and physical abilities. This includes providing an accessible platform with high quality assistive tools, and ensuring that other applications work well with these. The system includes assistive technologies to support users with various impairments and special needs, and to interact with common assistive devices.

Orca is screen reading software suitable for vision impaired and blind users. 

Orca is an assistive technology for people with visual impairments. Using various combinations of speech synthesis and Braille, Orca helps provide access to applications and toolkits that support the assistive technology service provider interface (AT-SPI), e.g. the GNOME desktop.
