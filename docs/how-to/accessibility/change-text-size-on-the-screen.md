# Change text size on the screen

If you have difficulty reading the text on your screen, you can change the size of the font.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click on {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Seeing` section.
4. Enable the {guilabel}`Large Text` option.

Alternatively, you can quickly change the text size by clicking the {ref}`accessibility icon <find-the-accessibility-menu>` on the top bar and selecting {guilabel}`Large Text`.

Large Text scales the text by 1.2 times. You can use Tweaks to make text size bigger or smaller.

:::{tip}
In many applications, you can increase the text size at any time by pressing {kbd}`Ctrl++`. To reduce the text size, press {kbd}`Ctrl+-`.
