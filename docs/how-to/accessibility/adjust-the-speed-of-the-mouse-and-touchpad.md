# Adjust the speed of the mouse and touchpad

If your pointer moves too fast or slow when you move your mouse or use your touchpad, you can adjust the pointer speed for these devices.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **mouse & touchpad**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Mouse & Touchpad` to open the panel.
3. Adjust the {guilabel}`Pointer Speed` slider until the pointer motion is comfortable for you. Sometimes the most comfortable settings for one type of device are not the best for the other.

:::{note}
The {guilabel}`Touchpad` section only appears if your system has a touchpad, while the {guilabel}`Mouse` section is only visible when a mouse is connected.
