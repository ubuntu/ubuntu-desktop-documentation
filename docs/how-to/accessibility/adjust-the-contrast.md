# Adjust the contrast

You can adjust the contrast of windows and buttons so that they’re easier to see. This is not the same as changing the brightness of the whole screen; only parts of the user interface will change.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Seeing` section.
4. Enable the {guilabel}`High Contrast` option.

:::{tip}
You can turn high contrast on and off by clicking the {ref}`accessibility icon <find-the-accessibility-menu>` on the top bar and selecting {guilabel}`High Contrast`.
