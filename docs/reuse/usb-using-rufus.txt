Rufus presents many options in its interface. It's safe to leave most of them with their default values.

1. Download and install the latest version of Rufus from the [rufus.ie](https://rufus.ie/) website.

    If you're using Windows 7, install [version 3.22](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.22/rufus-3.22.exe) of Rufus. On Windows XP or Vista, install [version 2.18](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v2.18/rufus-2.18.exe).

1. Launch Rufus.

    If prompted, allow online updates.

1. Insert your USB stick. It appears in the {guilabel}`Device` field.

    If {guilabel}`Device` shows the wrong USB device, select the correct one from the drop-down menu.

1. Click {guilabel}`SELECT` next to {guilabel}`Boot selection`. Choose the Ubuntu image file that you've downloaded and confirm by clicking {guilabel}`Open`.

1. Click {guilabel}`START` to write the image to USB.

1. If Rufus asks to download additional files to complete writing the image, select {guilabel}`Yes` to continue.

1. Rufus tells you that the Ubuntu image is an *ISOHybrid image*. This means that the same image file can be used as the source for both a USB stick and a DVD.

    Confirm the *Write in ISO Image mode* option.

1. Rufus warns you that all data on the USB device is about to be destroyed. Double-check that you've selected the correct device and confirm by clicking {guilabel}`OK`.

1. Rufus is now writing the image to USB. This usually takes around 10 minutes.

1. When Rufus has finished writing to the USB device, the Status bar says {guilabel}`READY`.

    Click {guilabel}`CLOSE` to complete the write process.
