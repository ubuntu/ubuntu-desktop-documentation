## Download an Ubuntu image

Get the Ubuntu installation image from the [Download Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) page. Save it to a memorable location on your PC. The downloaded file is called `ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso` or similar.

## Create a bootable USB stick

Write the downloaded Ubuntu image to a USB stick to create the installation media. This is not the same as copying the downloaded image file: you have to use special software.

We'll use the balenaEtcher application because it runs on Linux, Windows and macOS.

1. At the [balenaEtcher website](https://etcher.balena.io/), choose the version that corresponds to your current operating system.

1. Download and install the tool.

1. Insert your USB flash drive.

1. Open balenaEtcher.

1. Select the downloaded Ubuntu image and your USB flash drive.

1. Click {guilabel}`Flash!` to write the image.

Now you have a USB stick that works as Ubuntu installation media.


## Boot from the USB flash drive

1. Insert the USB stick into the laptop or PC where you want to install Ubuntu.

1. Restart the computer.

1. Your device should recognize the installation media and launch the Ubuntu installer.

    If not, restart it again. This time, hold {kbd}`F12` during startup. In the boot menu that appears, select your USB device.

    {kbd}`F12` is the most common key for bringing up the system boot menu but {kbd}`Escape`, {kbd}`F2` and {kbd}`F10` are common alternatives. If unsure, look for a brief message when your system starts: this often informs you which key to press to access the boot menu. You can also find the right key in the documentation for your laptop or PC.
