1. Launch the *Disk Utility* app from {menuselection}`Applications --> Utilities` or from the Spotlight search.

1. Insert your USB stick. It appears in the sidebar. Select it there.

    You might need to enable the {menuselection}`View --> Show All Devices` option.

    :::{warning}
    Make sure to select the USB stick and **not** your internal macOS disk. Both are listed.
    :::

1. To ensure compatibility with Apple hardware, reformat the USB stick with the GUID partition table:

    Select {guilabel}`Erase` from the toolbar.

    Set the format to *MS-DOS (FAT)* and the scheme to *GUID Partition Map*.

    Check that you've chosen the correct device and click {guilabel}`Erase`.

1. Click {guilabel}`Restore` ({guilabel}`↺`) in the toolbar.

1. Click {guilabel}`Image…` and select the Ubuntu image file.

1. Click {guilabel}`Restore`.

1. Wait for the writing to finish.

1. After the write process has completed, macOS might inform you that "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer".

    Select {guilabel}`Eject` and remove the USB device. Don't select {guilabel}`Initialize`.
