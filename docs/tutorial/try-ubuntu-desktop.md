# Try Ubuntu Desktop

In this tutorial, you'll try Ubuntu Desktop on your computer without making any permanent changes. Ubuntu Desktop will run from a USB drive and your data will be safe.


What you’ll need:

* A laptop or PC.

* A flash drive (12GB or above recommended).


## Will Ubuntu work on my computer?

You can test Ubuntu from a USB drive on any computer to see if it works.

You can also try to find your computer on the [Ubuntu certified hardware](https://ubuntu.com/certified?q=&category=Laptop&category=Desktop&limit=20) page. These devices have been tested and confirmed to work well with Ubuntu.

## Follow the installer

The Ubuntu Desktop installer opens. We'll use it to set a couple of options. Then we'll close it without installing anything on your computer.

1. Choose your language.

1. Select any accessibility settings that your require.

1. Select your keyboard layout.

1. Connect to your network.

    This allows Ubuntu to download updates and third party drivers, such as NVIDIA graphics drivers, during installation.

    It also allows you to use a web browser in the Ubuntu preview.

    The network connection is optional. If you can't connect, the Ubuntu preview will still work.

8. The installer gives you the choice to try or install Ubuntu.

    Click {guilabel}`Try Ubuntu` so that you can preview Ubuntu without making any changes to your PC.

## Test the Ubuntu preview

The installer closes. Use the preview to test if your hardware works correctly with Ubuntu.

Look around the interface and see what applications are available.

If you decide to install Ubuntu, return to the installer menu at any time by clicking the {guilabel}`Install Ubuntu` shortcut on the desktop. See {ref}`install-ubuntu-desktop` to proceed with the installation.

When you're done testing Ubuntu and you don't want to install it, you can reboot the computer and return to your regular system:

1. Click the menu in the upper right corner of the screen on the top bar.

1. Click the power button.

1. Select {guilabel}`Restart` and confirm.

1. Ubuntu asks you to remove your USB flash drive from the device. Once you’ve done this, press {guilabel}`Enter`.

1. Your computer restarts and loads your regular system.
